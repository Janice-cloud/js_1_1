      // Basic JavaScript: Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
      // String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote.
      // Single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript
      // Use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character. 
      // Reason why to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string
