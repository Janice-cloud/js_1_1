// Basic JavaScript: Understanding Boolean Values
// Another data type is the Boolean
// Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false.
// Basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off."
// These two states are mutually exclusive.
// Boolean values are never written with quotes.
// The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.
