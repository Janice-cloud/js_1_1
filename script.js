// Basic JavaScript: Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
// Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called
// When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. 
// The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

function functionWithArgs(num1, num2) {
    var sum = num1 + num2;
    console.log(sum);
}

functionWithArgs(1, 2);
