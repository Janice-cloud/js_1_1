// Basic JavaScript:  Understand String Immutability
// String values are immutable
// Means that they cannot be altered once created.
// Individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed
// The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string

var myStr = "Jello World";

myStr = "Hello World";
console.log(myStr);
